# Scenario Example â€” Credit-Triggered Note

## ðŸ“ˆ Scenario 1: Normal Maturity Path

### Initial Setup:

* User invests principal of Â¥100,000
* Underlying asset is a certain high-yield bond, observation period is 15 days
* Total term of 1 year, annual coupon rate 10%, paid quarterly (4 payments)

### Path Evolution:

1. User enters the structured note, freeze period begins (Days 0-15)
2. No knock-out triggered â†’ Day 15 releases observation period discount compensation (**Actual calculation: Â¥205.69**)
3. Quarterly coupon payments: Â¥2,500, four times in total
4. Principal returned at maturity: Â¥100,000

### Summary:

* **Actual Model Calculation Results**:
  - Normal path value: Â¥104,816.22
  - Observation period compensation: Â¥205.69
  - Total expected value: Â¥105,021.91
* Annualized yield â‰ˆ 5.02%
* Structure operates safely, no default events

## ðŸš¨ Scenario 2: Credit Score Triggers Knock-Out

### Initial Setup:

* Same as above, user invests Â¥100,000
* On Day 30, company releases financial reports, ICR and current ratio decline sharply

### Risk Control Path:

1. Scoring function outputs score < 50 for 3 consecutive days â†’ Knock-out triggered
2. **System automatically calculates**:
   - Discounted value of remaining cash flows: Â¥104,816.22
   - Risk premium: Â¥5,000
   - **Total payout amount: Â¥109,816.22**
3. User automatically receives payout, structure terminates, no further participation in subsequent fluctuations

### Summary:

* User receives Â¥109,816.22, a return of +9.82% relative to principal
* Structure actively circuit-breaks before credit risk exposure, securing the outcome
* **Significant downside protection effect**

## ðŸ’¬ Scenario Interpretation Guide

| Path | User Experience | Corresponding Structural Advantage | Actual Return |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Normal Path | Receives all coupons, anticipates enclosed returns | Observation period reimbursement enhances perceived reasonability | +5.02% |
| Knock-out Path | No active operation required, automatic payout triggered | Transparent, adjustable risk control mechanism, enhanced user trust | +9.82% |

## ðŸ“Š Sensitivity Analysis Scenarios

### Scenario 3: Expected Performance Under Different Knock-Out Probabilities

Sensitivity analysis results based on the latest model:

| Knock-Out Probability | Expected Value | Return Relative to Principal | Risk Level |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 0.0%    | Â¥105,021.91 | +5.02% | Very Low |
| 10.0%   | Â¥104,501.33 | +4.50% | Low |
| 20.0%   | Â¥103,980.75 | +3.98% | Medium-Low |
| 30.0%   | Â¥103,460.17 | +3.46% | Medium |
| 40.0%   | Â¥102,939.59 | +2.94% | Medium-High |
| 50.0%   | Â¥102,419.01 | +2.42% | High |

### Key Observations:
- **Downside Protection**: Even at the highest knock-out probability (50%), investors still achieve positive returns
- **Risk Compensation**: Higher knock-out probabilities correspond to more significant risk premiums
- **Stability**: Return fluctuation range is controlled within a reasonable interval
