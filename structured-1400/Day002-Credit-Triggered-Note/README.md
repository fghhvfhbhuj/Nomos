# Credit-Triggered Redemption Note

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is part of the Structured-1400 series, specifically the second structured product, designed to create a **credit-event-triggered automatic payout structured note**. It aims to provide an educational, customizable, and visualized demonstration of the complete process of structured financial product design, from logical construction to pricing modeling.

The project adopts a modular design, supports sensitivity analysis, and generates professional-grade reports, making it suitable for financial engineering education, research, and real-world product development.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Structural Logic

* Upon purchasing the structured note, clients enter an **observation period** (default: 15 days). During this period, no returns are accrued, but funds receive **discount compensation** (annualized interest discount) if the structure does not knock out.
* If no knock-out event occurs after the observation period, the structure transitions to the main return path, ultimately delivering principal and agreed returns (including observation period compensation).
* If the **risk-control knock-out mechanism** is triggered at any point, the structure terminates immediately, paying:

$$
\text{Discounted Future Cash Flows} + \text{Credit Risk Premium (Insurance)}
$$

**Latest Model Results:**
- Normal Path Value: Â¥104,816.22
- Observation Period Compensation: Â¥205.69
- Knock-Out Payout Value: Â¥109,816.22

## ðŸ§  Educational Objectives

This project is tailored for learners focusing on structured product design, covering the following objectives:

* Learn how to construct path-triggered structured product logic (observation period + risk-control knock-out + payout structure).
* Understand how to embed **risk management logic** and "anti-arbitrage design" into contracts.
* Demonstrate how to use Python to develop **pricing models and probability sensitivity analysis** for structured notes.
* Provide a pluggable risk-scoring function template for users to customize trigger mechanisms.
* Showcase professional-grade financial modeling and report generation capabilities.
