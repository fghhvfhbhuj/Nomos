# Derivative Structure Day004 Scenario Examples

This section aims to demonstrate the performance of the Day004 Volatility-Triggered Multi-Currency Arbitrage Structure under different market conditions through specific scenario examples, helping to understand the structure's execution mechanism and potential arbitrage behaviors.

---

## Scenario 1: High Volatility Triggering Arbitrage Path

* **Market Background**: The USD/JPY currency pair experiences severe volatility in global markets, with arbitrage yield reaching 0.0023.
* **Structure Response**:
  * Reaches knock-in threshold d=0.002, immediately enters arbitrage state
  * Selects path: USD → JPY → CNY → GBP → USD
  * System detects path exchange rates: 1 → 110.0 → 6.45 → 0.72 → 1.0032
  * Transaction fee per trade is 0.001, total fee for 4 trades is 0.004, net arbitrage yield is -0.0008
  * However, due to volatility, the arbitrage yield exceeds the threshold, triggering the structure
* **Execution Behavior**:
  * User locks in forward currency return prices through foreign exchange swaps within 3 minutes
  * Expected profit locked at 0.3% of principal

## Scenario 2: High Volatility Followed by Rapid Arbitrage Yield Compression, Knock-Out Exit

* **Market Background**: CNY against USD experiences severe volatility after non-farm payroll data release, creating a short-term arbitrage window, but the arbitrage path yield falls within 20 minutes.
* **Structure Response**:
  * Initial arbitrage yield reaches 0.0025, exceeding knock-in threshold d=0.002, initiating path execution
  * After execution, monitored expected arbitrage yield drops to 0.0004
  * Triggers knock-out threshold z=0.0005, system forces exit from arbitrage path
* **Execution Behavior**:
  * If user has not completed swap operation, there is no yield at exit
  * If swap is completed, arbitrage return is settled at the locked-in price

## Scenario 3: Overly Complex Arbitrage Path Leading to Excessive Total Fees

* **Market Background**: Attempting to use a 6-currency path (USD → EUR → JPY → CNY → GBP → USD)
* **Structure Response**:
  * Although partial arbitrage opportunities exist in certain segments, total fees amount to 6 × 0.001 = 0.006, while path arbitrage yield is only 0.0042
  * Net yield is -0.0018, failing to exceed knock-in threshold d=0.002, structure remains inactive
* **Execution Behavior**:
  * System continues monitoring other paths, structure not activated

## Scenario 4: High Volatility Environment Predicted by GARCH Model

* **Market Background**:
  * GARCH(1,1) model predicts significant increase in currency pair volatility over the next 30 days
  * Current volatility has begun to rise, arbitrage paths starting to emerge
* **Structure Response**:
  * System predicts imminent arbitrage opportunities, prepares path execution resources in advance
  * When arbitrage yield breaks through d=0.002, knock-in is immediately triggered
* **Execution Behavior**:
  * System optimizes execution timing based on volatility path predicted by GARCH model
  * Expected holding period around 15 days, followed by knock-out when volatility subsides

## Scenario 5: National Intervention Resistance Function Limiting Extreme Yields

* **Market Background**:
  * A currency pair experiences extreme volatility, theoretically offering high arbitrage yields
  * But due to the national intervention resistance function $intervention = -0.01 \cdot \tanh(deviation \cdot 10)$
* **Structure Response**:
  * In system simulation, extreme yields are suppressed by the resistance function
  * Actual yield fluctuations are controlled within a more reasonable range
* **Execution Behavior**:
  * System selects more robust arbitrage paths, avoiding extreme situations susceptible to government intervention
  * Completes swap lock-in before yield falls to z=0.0005

## Conclusion

Through the above five different scenario examples, we can more clearly understand the performance and challenges of the Day004 Volatility-Triggered Structure under different market environments, path settings, and operational efficiencies. These scenarios are all based on the model functions implemented in pricing_model.py, including static volatility and GARCH volatility models, as well as features like the national intervention resistance function.
