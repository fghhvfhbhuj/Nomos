# ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Disclosure ‚Äì Stoa Note (Structure No.18)

This document outlines the potential risks associated with **Stoa Note**, an experimental derivative structure based on non-tradable friction variables such as transaction fees, slippage, and gas costs. The structure incorporates anchoring, zone compression, and asymmetric payout dynamics. While academically valuable and conceptually innovative, it is essential to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties, model limitations, and market realities that impact its deployment.

## 1. Market Risk

* **Underlying Volatility**: The Effective Fee Index (EFI) is highly sensitive to congestion, regulatory policy shifts, and micro-market anomalies. Large unpredictable spikes could exceed model assumptions.
* **Anchoring Drift**: The reliability of anchoring variables (e.g., ETH gas cost benchmarks) is not guaranteed. In stressed markets, anchors may decouple from expected behavior.

## 2. Model Risk

* **Non-Martingale Base**: EFI is not a martingale process; this structure assumes bounded behavior, which may not hold during black swan events.
* **Compression Error**: The compressed payout band (`Œµ + Œ¥`) may incorrectly exclude meaningful deviations, resulting in under-compensated risk.
* **Œº-Bias Fragility**: The asymmetric center (`Œº`) is a subjective design parameter; misestimation could lead to structurally unbalanced payouts.

## 3. Liquidity & Tradability Risk

* **Lack of Real Counterparties**: As a novel fee-based structure, there may be no natural market counterparty unless deployed via protocols or DAOs with aligned exposure.
* **Secondary Market Illiquidity**: If tokenized, NFT-wrapped versions of the note may suffer from low transferability and high slippage on resale.

## 4. Regulatory Risk

* **Undefined Asset Class**: Fee-indexed derivatives do not fall cleanly under traditional commodity, FX, or interest rate derivative categories.
* **Cross-Jurisdictional Concerns**: Anchored references (e.g., ETH gas) may fall under financial regulation in some countries, raising legal compliance issues.

## 5. Implementation Risk

* **Mirror Note Misalignment**: If the mirror structure used for anti-arbitrage deviates due to latency or mispricing, the system may exhibit unhedged exposure.
* **Data Oracle Dependence**: Accurate and timely data feeds are essential; corrupted or delayed oracles will affect payout integrity.
