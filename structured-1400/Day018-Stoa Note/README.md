# 🪞 Structure No.18 – Stoa Note

**Anchored Friction Derivative for Controlled Asymmetric Risk Extraction**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Stoa Note** is a friction-based derivative structure that transforms unpriceable market costs—such as transaction fees, slippage, and gas charges—into a structured financial product with risk-neutral properties and embedded asymmetric arbitrage potential. It is designed to be *un-arbitrageable itself*, while enabling targeted arbitrage of external friction inefficiencies.

## 🢩 Structural Design

| Layer                 | Component             | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core Payout           | Spike-Asymmetric Zone | Pays out when effective fee index (EFI) deviates beyond a compressed, biased band                      |
| Anchoring Layer       | Real Market Linkage   | EFI is dynamically adjusted via a real-world anchoring variable (e.g., ETH gas index, liquidity depth) |
| Compression Mechanism | Frictional Band       | Introduces a `±ε + δ` payout deadzone to absorb micro-noise and ensure stability                       |
| Shifted Center        | μ-Bias Control        | Payout center `μ` is intentionally displaced to create structural profit under asymmetry               |
| Anti-Arbitrage        | Mirror Structure      | A paired hedging structure offsets risk at equilibrium, ensuring overall neutrality                    |

## �� Mathematical Representation

Let:

* `f`: Effective Fee Index (EFI)
* `A(t)`: Anchoring signal (e.g., gas cost benchmark)
* `λ`: Anchoring sensitivity
* `f_adj = f - λ·A(t)`
* `μ`: Payout center (bias-controlled)
* `ε`: friction band; `δ`: compression offset
* `α₁`, `α₂`: asymmetric scaling coefficients

Then:

```
P(f_adj) =
    α₁ · (f_adj - μ - ε - δ), if f_adj > μ + ε + δ  
    α₂ · (μ - f_adj - ε - δ), if f_adj < μ - ε - δ  
    0, otherwise
```

## 🧐 Design Philosophy

* **Anchor the Unstable**: Transform unreplicable, non-martingale variables into a quantifiable payoff via market-linked reference points.
* **Compress the Uncertain**: Use friction bands and statistical thresholds to ensure payout precision.
* **Bias the Structure**: Shift the payoff center (`μ`) strategically to favor the issuer without exposing exploitable arbitrage.
* **Hedge the Risk**: Deploy a mirror derivative to cancel exposure when markets behave as expected.
