# üß™ Scenario Examples ‚Äì Stoa Note (Structure No.18)

This document illustrates practical scenarios in which **Stoa Note** operates as a structured friction derivative. Each example explores a unique configuration of the Effective Fee Index (EFI), anchoring mechanics, and payout behavior under real or simulated market conditions.

## Scenario 1: ETH Gas Surge on NFT Minting Day

**Context:** Major NFT launch on Ethereum leads to sudden gas fee spikes.

* **Anchoring Variable:** 1-hour rolling average of ETH base fee
* **Observed EFI Spike:** From 0.19% to 0.42%
* **Anchored Adjustment:** f\_adj = 0.42% - (Œª √ó 0.18%) = \~0.31%
* **Trigger:** Œº = 0.22%, Œµ = 0.05%, Œ¥ = 0.01%
* **Outcome:** f\_adj > Œº + Œµ + Œ¥ ‚Üí Positive payout of Œ±‚ÇÅ √ó (0.31 - 0.28)%

‚úÖ *Structure successfully detects and compensates for extreme fee anomalies while filtering ambient volatility.*

## Scenario 2: Cross-Exchange Slippage Arbitrage

**Context:** Fees on a Tier-2 exchange deviate from a multi-venue average due to liquidity mining incentives.

* **Anchoring Variable:** Composite index of top 5 centralized exchanges (CEXs)
* **Observed Fee Index:** Outlier platform reaches 0.35% vs anchor average of 0.15%
* **Adjustment:** Anchoring offset Œª = 0.6
* **Outcome:** Trigger activates, mirrored structure offsets slippage loss on primary execution venue.

‚úÖ *Stoa Note acts as a protective hedge for market makers exposed to unplanned routing inefficiencies.*

## Scenario 3: False Trigger During Low Activity

**Context:** Overnight inactivity on chain causes random minor fluctuations in reported fees.

* **EFI Oscillates:** 0.21% ‚Üí 0.24% ‚Üí 0.20%
* **Anchor Drift:** Minor
* **f\_adj Range:** Entirely within Œº ¬± (Œµ + Œ¥)
* **Outcome:** No payout, avoids overreaction to noise

‚úÖ *Zone compression prevents unnecessary payout in low-signal environments, protecting structure efficiency.*

## Scenario 4: Intentional Fee Inflation Attack

**Context:** An MEV bot floods transactions to inflate fees temporarily during illiquid hours.

* **Observed Spike:** 0.22% ‚Üí 0.47%
* **Anchoring Response:** f\_adj remains partially elevated due to delayed oracle rebalancing
* **Mirror Failure:** Partial mismatch leads to payout but mild structural exposure

‚ö†Ô∏è *Demonstrates importance of robust oracle and latency mitigation within the mirror pairing.*

## Scenario 5: Non-Market Anchoring ‚Äì Weather-Based Deviation Bias

**Context:** Stoa Note is repurposed in a weather-risk derivatives pilot.

* **Target Variable:** Local rainfall deviation as friction proxy in crop supply chain
* **Anchor:** NOAA satellite rainfall baseline (regional)
* **f\_adj = Rain Index - Œª √ó Forecast Bias**
* **Outcome:** Biased Œº tuned to favor structure issuer if rainfall below normal range

‚úÖ *Confirms generalizability of Stoa architecture to non-market variables with asymmetrically bounded uncertainty.*
