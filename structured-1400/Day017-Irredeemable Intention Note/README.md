# Structure No.017 â€“ Irredeemable Intention Noteâ„¢

## Overview

The Irredeemable Intention Note (IIN) is a symbolic financial construct designed to serve no economic utility.  
Once purchased, the structure instantly and irrevocably executes a pre-funded transfer to the recipient, and then self-seals.

This structure cannot be traded, withdrawn from, or used for speculation. It exists solely as an expression, a ceremony, a design of intent.

## Behavior

- Once bought, the structure immediately releases a pre-deposited blessing amount.
- The structure then transitions into a terminal state: no further action possible.
- The recipient may choose to **execute** or **preserve** the structure.
  - Execution: payout occurs, note archived
  - Preservation: note never pays out, becomes eternal on-chain monument

## Use Cases

- Symbolic financial letters to loved ones
- Emotional gifting via structured protocols
- Generational financial metaphors
- Non-economic smart contract training

## Deployment Guide

Please see the accompanying whitepaper for implementation instructions.
