# Structure No.017 â€“ Irredeemable Intention Note (IIN)

## Abstract

The Irredeemable Intention Note (IIN) is a ceremonial financial instrument with no economic function. It exists purely as a symbolic gesture. Upon purchase, the structure triggers a one-time transfer of a pre-funded amount to the intended recipient and self-destructs or transitions to an immutable archived state. This structure is irreversible, non-tradeable, and cannot be redeemed more than once.

This document serves as a technical and philosophical reference for constructing IINs and provides a practical implementation guideline for developers, financial designers, and symbolic system engineers.

## 1. Structure Overview

- **Type**: Non-economic one-time structure
- **Purpose**: Symbolic emotional transfer, often used for gifting, memorials, or rituals
- **Trigger Behavior**:
  - Purchase (execution) causes release of funds and permanent sealing
  - Optional: recipient can choose to either **Execute (Redeem)** or **Preserve (Seal)**
- **Guarantee**: Structure creator pre-funds an escrowed amount ("blessing capital")

---

## 2. Behavior Logic

- **States**:

  - `Created`: Structure initialized and visible
  - `Executed`: Triggered and payout released
  - `Sealed`: Preserved forever; payout forfeited

- **Transitions**:

  ```
  if msg.sender == recipient && structure.state == Created:
      if choice == Execute:
          release(blessing_capital)
          structure.state = Executed
      elif choice == Preserve:
          structure.state = Sealed
  ```

- **Finality**: No rollback possible after execution or sealing

---

## 3. Deployment Instructions

- Deploy a minimal smart contract on any EVM-compatible chain

- Key parameters:

  - `creator`: Address funding the blessing capital
  - `recipient`: Authorized redeemer
  - `blessing_capital`: Fixed payout amount
  - `metadata_uri`: IPFS pointer to message, graphics, optional NFT

- Recommended Toolchain:

  - Solidity (v0.8+)
  - Hardhat/Foundry
  - Pinata/IPFS for metadata

## 4. UI Design (Optional)

- **Welcome Page**

  - Title: "You have received a Structure."
  - Subtitle: "This is a gift, not an investment."

- **Recipient Options**:

  - [ Execute Blessing âœ¨ ]
  - [ Preserve Forever ðŸŒŒ ]

- **Post-action states**:

  - If Executed: "Blessing released. Structure archived."
  - If Preserved: "Structure sealed forever. Nothing was claimed."

---

## 5. Philosophical Notes

- The IIN is not a financial product, but a language of gesture encoded in structured financial logic.
- It explores the idea that **money can be intentionally rendered meaningless**, to elevate the meaning of the act itself.
- The choice to forgo redemption becomes a symbolic sacrifice, an emotional statement.
- It invites participants to ask: *"What does it mean to receive something you may choose not to open?"*
