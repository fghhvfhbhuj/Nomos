*A dual-structure Singapore-linked volatility note with latent regulatory event sensitivity.*

## 📌 Structure ID
**Structure1400-Day016**

## 🧠 Concept Summary

The Merlion Adaptive Return Note is a capital-preserving structured instrument designed to harness systemic volatility induced by latent policy signals in the Singapore financial ecosystem. 

Through the dual-layer architecture of `Merlion Shield` (yield enhancement note) and `Hydra Fang` (event-triggered derivative), the system achieves asymmetric exposure to market dislocation events while maintaining regulatory neutrality on surface.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

- **Merlion Shield**: Capital-protected note with tiered volatility participation
- **Hydra Fang**: Trigger-activated optionality layer linked to a custom systemic proxy index (FGEI)
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Based on multi-variable deviation across volatility, rate skew, and regulatory spread proxies

## 🎯 Design Intent

- Simulate regulatory signal tracking without direct market declaration
- Monetize volatility regime shifts in controlled trigger windows
- Provide a theoretical proof of structured path deviation under martingale-conforming surface pricing
