## 📈 Scenario 1: Stable Volatility, Low FGEI

- **SGX REIT Volatility**: 13.1% (baseline drift)
- **FGEI**: 0.48 (well below trigger)
- **Hydra Activation**: ❌ No

**Result**:
> Payout = Principal + 0%  
> Structure remains dormant, behaves as capital-preserving note.  
> Market exhibits no systemic stress proxy activation.

## ⚠️ Scenario 2: Moderate Policy Misalignment

- **SGX REIT Volatility**: 15.6%
- **FGEI**: 0.88 (within [K1, K2])
- **Hydra Activation**: ❌ No

**Result**:
> Payout = Principal + 10.3%  
> Note enters yield enhancement zone via partial stress participation.  
> Nonlinear curve begins to activate through λ₁ slope.  
> Structure perceived as “mildly outperforming safe note.”
