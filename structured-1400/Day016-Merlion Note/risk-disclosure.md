# üìâ Risk Disclosure ‚Äì Merlion Adaptive Return Note v2

This document outlines key risk considerations relevant to investors in the Merlion Adaptive Return Note, a volatility-linked structured product designed for Accredited Investors under Section 275 of the SFA.

---

## 1. Volatility Path Dependency Risk

The payout structure of the Note is linked to a conditional volatility regime that may vary substantially during market stress periods. While principal is preserved, the actual return may be materially affected by short-term volatility spikes or collapses in implied spread dynamics.

---

## 2. Event Volatility Window

The underlying payout logic includes a latent mechanism that may activate under multi-variable systemic behavior, which can introduce significant return nonlinearity. This may result in sudden shift in expected return even under stable market surface behavior.

---

## 3. Trigger Proxy Uncertainty

Returns are influenced by a proprietary Financial Governance Event Index (FGEI), which incorporates market-derived indicators of structural shifts. As this index is based on modeled proxies rather than observable market prices, its behavior may not always align with investor expectations or conventional benchmark behavior.

## 4. Regime Sensitivity Risk

The Note embeds payout structures that may change slope or behavior in non-standard ways during systemic stress periods. Investors should be aware that under certain regulatory intervention patterns, model behavior may deviate from classical asset pricing assumptions.

---

## 5. Liquidity Risk

Although the Note is intended to be held to maturity, investors should be aware that early redemption may be subject to internal valuation conditions. In cases of early call, systemic misalignment of payout proxies may affect final return calculation.

---

## 6. Modeling Discrepancy Risk

The structure utilizes simulation-based payout modeling with volatility-linked overlays. Classical Black-Scholes-based Greeks may not be representative of actual product behavior. Investors are advised to consult issuer modeling supplements before assuming risk symmetry.

---

## 7. Structural Information Asymmetry

The product contains layered conditional features designed to optimize behavior under specific market regimes. Full payout behavior may not be reconstructible from public documents and is provided in detail in investor-only modeling appendices.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Final Note

This product is not suitable for investors seeking fixed returns or fully transparent exposure. It is intended for market participants who understand volatility-driven structured products and accept the possibility of event-driven outcome deviation.
