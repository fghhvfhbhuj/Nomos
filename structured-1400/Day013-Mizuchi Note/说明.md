# Structure No.13: Mizuchi Note

**Title:** Mizuchi Note — The Hidden Serpent Beneath the Monetary Surface
**Type:** OTC Hybrid Triggered Structured Note
**Target Country:** Japan (Bank of Japan)

---

## 📐 Objective

Design a multi-layer OTC structured note that:

* **Externally** appears as a conventional multi-asset structured note (to mask true intent).
* **Internally** profits from the market's failure to immediately and correctly price in the BOJ's Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy shift.
* Implements an **information mispricing exploit**: rewards are paid if market response deviates from modeled expectations.

---

## 🤖 Structure Summary

### Layer 1: External Appearance

* Basket-linked note based on:

  * Nikkei 225
  * USD/JPY
  * Brent Crude
  * VIX Index
* Fixed coupon + bonus payout clauses

### Layer 2: Gamma/Volatility Exposure

* Embedded delta-neutral + gamma-positive structure
* Use of ATM straddles around key instruments

### Layer 3: Trigger Mechanism (Core)

* **Trigger Event:** BOJ officially raises its 10Y JGB yield cap > 1.25%
* **Trigger Window:** Observation period from T+1 to T+3 post-announcement
* **Payout Condition:** If market fails to reprice (price/vol remain within defined bounds), a bonus is paid

### Layer 4: Hidden Payoff Logic

* Reward function inversely correlated to market adjustment accuracy:

  * The less market reacts properly, the more the note pays

---

## 🔢 Payout Function (Simplified)

Let:

* $\Delta V = | \text{IV}_{\text{post}} - \text{IV}_{\text{pre}} |$
* $\Delta P = | \text{Nikkei}_{\text{post}} - \text{Nikkei}_{\text{pre}} |$
* $\epsilon_v = 10\%$, $\epsilon_p = 2\%$

$$
\text{Payout} =
\begin{cases}
C, & \text{if } \Delta V < \epsilon_v \text{ and } \Delta P < \epsilon_p \\
B, & \text{if } \Delta P < \epsilon_p \\
A, & \text{if } \Delta V < \epsilon_v \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## 🌐 Legal & Term Sheet Language

```text
This Note provides a fixed 4% return over 6 months.

In the event that the Bank of Japan officially announces an upward shift of its 10-year Yield Curve Control cap beyond 1.25%, a conditional adjustment monitoring window will begin.

If within the next three trading days:
- The implied volatility of USD/JPY fails to adjust by at least 10%
- OR Nikkei 225 stays within 2% of its pre-event close

Then:
- The Note pays a Strategic Mispricing Premium (SMP)
```

## 🪨 Implementation Plan

You will:

1. Write the full codebase in Python

   * Delta/gamma tracking on multiple assets
   * Volatility spread modeling (pre/post-event)
   * Simulated BOJ events and mispricing payoff detection
2. Write documentation and structure memo:

   * Include full Term Sheet
   * Mathematical derivations
   * Strategy notes and hedging commentary
3. Submit the finished markdown for audit and refinement

---

## 🔎 Audit Questions (for Review)

* Does the structure remain delta-neutral under normal conditions?
* Is gamma exposure adequately concentrated around likely event time?
* Can the payout function be legally embedded under OTC clauses?
* Are trigger conditions measurable and auditable from public data?

## 📊 Strategic Value

* ❌ Hides true intent through multi-asset masking
* ✅ Profits from market inefficiency rather than market direction
* ⚖️ Balances regulation, market logic, and psychological traps

## 🎨 Aesthetic Statement

Mizuchi Note is not merely a financial tool; it is a “derivative poem” written in the language of market reflex delay. Where others model prices, you model how people fail to model. A weaponized mirror.

## ✅ Next Step

Begin implementation. When code and docs are ready, submit back for review.

The serpent sleeps below the rate curve. Until you awaken it.
