## Executive Summary

This whitepaper introduces an innovative structured financial product—the Adaptive Margin-Control Note (AMCN). By integrating margin mechanisms, yield caps, and fund pool designs, this product creates an investment tool capable of providing risk buffers in highly volatile market environments. The document elaborates on the design concept, structural mechanisms, risk control logic, and applicable scenarios, validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

## 1. Design Background and Concept

### 1.1 Market Demand Analysis

In today's financial markets, investors face key dilemmas:
- Balancing high returns with controlled risk.
- Maximizing gains in bullish markets while ensuring protection in bearish markets.
- Requiring flexible leverage control mechanisms beyond fixed leverage structures.

Traditional structured products like Snowball, Phoenix, and Sharkfin fail to meet these demands as they typically fix risk exposure at inception, lacking dynamic adjustment based on market changes.

### 1.2 Innovative Design Concept

The core concept of the Adaptive Margin-Control Note includes:
- **Dynamic Fund Allocation**: Storing potential excess returns as risk buffer funds.
- **Risk Adaptive Adjustment**: Automatically adjusting risk exposure based on market trends.
- **Investor Participation Control**: Empowering investors to intervene and manage risks.

This design enables the product to exhibit distinct characteristics in varying market environments—locking in gains during bull markets and providing risk buffers during bear markets.

## 2. Product Structure and Mechanisms

### 2.1 Basic Structure

The Adaptive Margin-Control Note is a path-dependent structured product comprising the following core components:

1. **Underlying Asset Linkage**: Pegged to specific underlying assets (e.g., indices, futures).
2. **Knock-In Mechanism**: Triggered when the underlying asset's growth exceeds a specific threshold.
3. **Yield Cap**: Setting a maximum yield limit.
4. **Fund Pool Mechanism**: Storing excess returns for risk hedging.
5. **Margin Control System**: Establishing initial and maintenance margin levels.

### 2.2 Detailed Mechanism Explanation

#### 2.2.1 Knock-In and Yield Cap Mechanism

When the cumulative return of the underlying asset reaches the knock-in threshold (e.g., 20%):
- The yield cap mechanism (e.g., 30%) is triggered.
- Excess returns beyond the cap are transferred to the protection fund pool.
- Once triggered, this mechanism remains effective until product maturity.

#### 2.2.2 Fund Pool Operation Logic

The fund pool is the core innovation of this product, operating as follows:
- Initially empty.
- Accumulates funds from excess returns post-knock-in.
- Automatically activates when account equity falls below the maintenance margin line.
- Provides intelligent margin replenishment to prevent forced liquidation.
- Allows users to actively utilize pool funds for intervention.

#### 2.2.3 Margin Control System

The margin system adopts a mechanism similar to futures trading:
- Initial margin (e.g., 10% of principal) serves as the starting risk control line.
- Maintenance margin (e.g., 5% of principal) acts as the forced liquidation warning line.
- If account equity falls below the maintenance margin and the fund pool is empty, the product terminates.

### 2.3 Yield Calculation Formula

The basic yield calculation logic is as follows:

1. Underlying asset return rate: $R_t = \frac{S_t - S_0}{S_0}$

2. Final yield calculation:
   - If no knock-in ($R_T \leq$ knock-in threshold): Yield = $R_T \times$ Principal.
   - If knock-in occurs ($R_T >$ knock-in threshold):
     - Yield = min($R_T$, Yield Cap) × Principal.
     - Fund Pool = max(0, $R_T$ - Yield Cap) × Principal.

3. Risk control adjustment:
   - If the lowest equity point during the path < Maintenance Margin:
     - Use fund pool to cover the gap (if possible).
     - If insufficient, yield = lowest equity value.

## 4. Pricing Model and Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Pricing Methodology

The product employs Monte Carlo simulation for pricing, including:

1. Simulating numerous (10,000) random price paths.
2. Calculating final yields and fund pool changes for each path.
3. Checking activation of risk control mechanisms.
4. Computing expected yield as theoretical value.

The pricing model incorporates advanced stochastic processes to simulate realistic market behavior:

1. **Jump Diffusion Model**: Combines continuous price changes and discrete jumps for accurate market event capture.
   $dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t + S_t dJ_t$

   Parameters:
   - Jump frequency (λ): 5 times/year.
   - Jump size mean: -1%.
   - Jump size standard deviation: 3%.

2. **Stochastic Volatility Model**: Volatility follows a mean-reverting stochastic process, similar to the Heston model.
   $d\sigma_t = \kappa(\theta - \sigma_t)dt + \xi\sqrt{\sigma_t}dW_t^{\sigma}$

   Parameters:
   - Mean reversion speed (κ): 3.0.
   - Long-term volatility mean (θ): 0.2 (20%).
   - Volatility of volatility (ξ): 0.3 (30%).

This hybrid model captures:
- Volatility smile/skew phenomena.
- Extreme events (tail risks).
- Market liquidity shifts.
- Volatility clustering effects.

### 4.2 Risk Metrics and Analysis

Based on simulation results, key risk metrics include:

1. **Expected Yield**: -1.38% (theoretical note value).
2. **Value at Risk (VaR)**:
   - 95% confidence level: -32.38%.
   - 99% confidence level: -42.74%.
3. **Conditional VaR (CVaR/Expected Shortfall)**: -38.78%.
4. **Maximum Drawdown**: Average of 27.64%.
5. **Knock-In Probability**: 33.43%.
6. **Forced Liquidation Probability**: 0%.

The model provides volatility sensitivity analysis, showing product performance variations across volatility environments (15%-35%). Performance is optimal at moderate volatility levels (20%) but risks increase significantly in extreme volatility (>35%).
