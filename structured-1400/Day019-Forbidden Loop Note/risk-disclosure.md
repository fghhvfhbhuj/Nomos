The Forbidden Loop Note is a complex structured product that incorporates derivative elements not replicable using the full range of legal financial instruments currently available within the PRC. While its design anticipates a theoretical arbitrage path, that path depends on instruments (e.g., option-on-digital-on-volatility) that are not legally tradable, accessible, or clearable in China.

### Key Risks:

* **Non-Risk-Neutral Pricing:** The product is intentionally priced outside classical replication models. Investors may not be compensated for risk in line with traditional derivatives.
* **Regulatory Limitation Exposure:** Any attempt to replicate or hedge this structure may encounter regulatory barriers that could invalidate the strategy.
* **Liquidity Risk:** The note is not listed and may not be transferable. Investors must be prepared to hold to maturity.
* **Valuation Ambiguity:** Proprietary pricing means investors may not observe real-time fair value marks.
* **Complex Payoff Conditions:** Dual triggers and path-dependence introduce uncertainty. The payoff may be difficult to project or model ex-ante.

### Investor Suitability:

This product is only suitable for institutional clients and highly sophisticated investors who:

* Understand structured payoff profiles involving volatility and path dependence
* Accept that no effective hedging strategy may exist
* Do not require public market liquidity
* Are comfortable with embedded regulatory-based pricing asymmetry

By purchasing this product, the investor acknowledges and accepts that the structure’s payoff is based on a legally non-replicable architecture. Arbitrage-based pricing corrections cannot be enforced, and the investor’s return will follow the structure’s bespoke design.
