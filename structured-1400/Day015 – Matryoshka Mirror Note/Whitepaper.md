# Annex A  
**Technical Risk Schedule and Scenario Disclosures**

---

### 1. Volatility Trigger Risk

- **Definition**: The enhanced return is dependent on the realization of a composite volatility index calculated using RUB/USD exchange rate dynamics and Urals/Brent spread behavior.
- **Risk**: Investors may not be able to replicate or predict trigger points due to model complexity and adjustment discretion.
- **Scenario**: A volatility spike occurs outside the scheduled observation window; investor expects enhanced return, but baseline return applies due to time mismatch.

---

### 2. Participation Eligibility Risk

- **Definition**: Enhanced return is conditional upon the investor maintaining uninterrupted exposure during SPV-evaluated structural windows.
- **Risk**: Investors who enter late or exit early may not qualify for bonus return layers.
- **Scenario**: Investor redeems before full window completion; classified as non-participant, receives only 12% baseline interest.

---

### 3. Early Redemption Risk

- **Definition**: The issuer may execute a redemption clause at its discretion once trigger conditions are met.
- **Risk**: Investor holding period may be shorter than anticipated; reinvestment options may not match original risk profile.
- **Scenario**: Trigger activates at Month 11; issuer redeems the note at par + 10% accrued; investor misses potential 28% upside.

---

### 4. Model Discretion Risk

- **Definition**: Payoff functions, thresholds, and volatility mapping are administered by the SPV via undisclosed calibration models.
- **Risk**: Investors cannot audit or validate payout path logic.
- **Scenario**: Historical backtest suggests payout should occur, but SPV model determines no activation based on internal scenario set.

---

### 5. FX and Benchmark Dislocation

- **Definition**: Structural dependencies on RUB/USD and energy benchmarks may expose note performance to market dislocations or data anomalies.
- **Risk**: Trigger evaluations may be disrupted by pricing gaps, illiquidity, or policy intervention.
- **Scenario**: Sudden RUB revaluation or benchmark outage causes model delay, pushing decision window beyond trigger range.
