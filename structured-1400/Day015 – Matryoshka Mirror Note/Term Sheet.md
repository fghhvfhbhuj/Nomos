**Structured Investment Note – Private Placement Only**  
*Qualified Investors | Not for Public Distribution*

## 🔷 Executive Summary

**Matryoshka Mirror Note** is a multi-layer structured investment note designed to offer enhanced yield exposure linked to a composite index of RUB volatility and Urals/Brent spread dynamics, with capital preservation features and a discretionary issuer call mechanism.

Structured within an SPV-based offshore framework and tied to energy-export currency correlations, the note leverages the short-term disequilibrium between public inflation disclosures and market pricing behavior.

## 🔷 Return Structure

| Scenario | Description | Investor Return |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Baseline Case** | No volatility trigger met | 12% p.a. simple interest |
| **Volatility Triggered** | 90-day composite volatility exceeds adjusted threshold at observation date | Dynamic return within 18%–28% (subject to SPV payoff curve) |
| **Early Redemption** | Issuer elects call option post-trigger recognition | Fixed 10% accrued + notional repaid |

> _“Volatility thresholds and payoff mapping are calibrated periodically by the issuer's designated model agent, under a stochastic path adjustment schema referencing synthetic energy-currency correlation regimes.”_

## 🔷 Trigger Mechanics (Simplified)

Trigger event is considered met if:

- 90-day historical volatility of the Urals/Brent Spread Index exceeds a dynamic percentile derived from a moving Gaussian mixture calibration;
- and implied USD/RUB skew exceeds 1.25× of baseline estimated range.

> _The volatility model is maintained externally and not published in full. Investors may refer to historical benchmark volatility bands for indicative understanding only._

## 🔷 SPV and Risk Management

All embedded options and correlation overlays are managed within a designated offshore SPV vehicle, registered in a neutral jurisdiction. Trigger evaluation, dynamic threshold resets, and payout function adjustments are controlled exclusively by the SPV under a non-disclosed optimization protocol.

---

## 🔷 Participation Condition

Investor must maintain active exposure within the structural window during trigger assessment periods.  
Exposure discontinuity may lead to forfeiture of enhanced payout eligibility and trigger automatic reversion to baseline return structure.

> _Participation is determined based on holding record reconciliation provided by primary dealer. SPV reserves the right to apply partial exclusion mechanism in cases of perceived opportunistic allocation._

## 🔷 Key Risks (Excerpt)

- **Model Discretion Risk**: Payoff structure is determined by SPV-run proprietary models, not publicly replicable.
- **Participation Gatekeeping**: Investors not continuously engaged during certain structural windows may receive reduced or zero enhanced returns.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Early redemption by issuer may occur without prior investor initiation.
- **Volatility Drift**: Trigger zones are floating and subject to path-dependent deformation.
