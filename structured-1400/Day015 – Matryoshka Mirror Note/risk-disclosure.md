**Matryoshka Mirror Note – Risk Disclosure Statement**  
*For Qualified Investor Review Only*

---

## 📘 Legal Notice

This document provides an outline of key risk categories associated with the Matryoshka Mirror Note (the “Note”). It does not replace or supersede the complete Term Sheet, Subscription Agreement, or SPV Structural Documentation. By subscribing, investors acknowledge full understanding of the risks described herein and accept the outcome of path-dependent or model-driven decisions.

---

## 🔷 1. Market Volatility Risk

The Note’s performance is partially dependent on observed volatility in RUB/USD exchange rates and energy benchmark spread behavior.  
Volatility is not deterministic, and past behavior may not predict future triggers. Investors should be aware that even significant price movements may not result in enhanced payouts.

---

## 🔷 2. Model Calibration Risk

The trigger mechanism and payout regime are governed by proprietary models operated by the issuer’s SPV. These models utilize synthetic calibration regimes, dynamic interpolation, and forward-adjusted thresholding.  
Investors have no visibility into these models and cannot replicate trigger outcomes using public data.

---

## 🔷 3. Participation Binding Risk

Enhanced returns are only accessible to investors who maintain continuous exposure during designated evaluation windows.  
Discontinuity of holdings, even for short durations, may result in complete forfeiture of bonus payout rights.

---

## 🔷 4. Early Redemption Risk

The issuer retains the right to redeem the Note prior to maturity upon internal trigger recognition.  
Such redemption may result in reduced upside relative to market conditions. Investors will receive par plus accrued baseline interest, with no guarantee of enhanced returns.

---

## 🔷 5. Liquidity and Transferability Risk

The Note is non-transferable and may not be resold, pledged, or assigned without prior issuer approval.  
There is no secondary market, and investors must assume full hold-to-maturity positioning unless early call is exercised by the issuer.

---

## 🔷 6. Behavioral Misalignment Risk

Investor expectations of payout behavior may differ from actual SPV-determined results.  
Predictive modeling based on publicly observable volatility or spreads may yield incorrect assumptions, as structural triggers incorporate behavioral metrics not disclosed.

---

## 🔷 7. FX Regulation and Conversion Risk

Although denominated in RUB, settlement may be conducted in USD depending on capital controls and investor preference.  
Conversion rates used in final settlement may differ from spot rates and may be determined using adjusted curves.

---

## 🔷 8. Dispute Limitation Clause

All structural interpretations, trigger validations, and payout mappings are final as determined by the SPV.  
Investors waive any right to retroactive dispute, modeling challenge, or loss recovery arising from non-activation of perceived triggers.
