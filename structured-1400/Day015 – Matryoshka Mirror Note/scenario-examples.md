## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 1: Baseline Case â€“ No Trigger Activation

**Market Conditions:**

- USD/RUB stable at 89.5 Â± 1.2 for 3 months
- Urals/Brent spread at $12.5 Â± $0.8
- Composite 90-day volatility percentile = 67th

**Trigger Outcome:**  
â†’ Volatility percentile did not exceed activation threshold (estimated ~72.5th)  
â†’ SPV model determined baseline path applicable

**Payout Result:**  
â†’ Investor receives 12.0% annualized interest at maturity

---

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 2: Apparent Trigger Zone â€“ Enhancement Expected

**Market Conditions:**

- USD/RUB spikes from 90 to 95 in a 5-day window
- Urals/Brent spread spikes from $11.8 to $14.7
- Backtest model suggests volatility percentile = 79.3

**Trigger Outcome:**  
â†’ SPV model flags mismatch in forward skew projection  
â†’ Trigger recognized, but enhancement suppressed via delayed model reset

**Payout Result:**  
â†’ Issuer exercises early call at month 11  
â†’ Investor receives 10% accrued + notional, enhancement not unlocked

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 3: False Positive Window â€“ Arbitrage Attempt

**Investor Strategy:**  
Investor anticipates Q3 energy volatility spike based on geopolitical event, buys in at Month 6.

**Market Conditions:**

- Composite volatility hits 73.9 percentile  
- SPV shifts model parameters due to short-term liquidity dislocation  
- Path index enters "conditional holding" state

**Trigger Outcome:**  
â†’ SPV resets internal threshold up to 75.2 percentile  
â†’ No trigger recognized

**Payout Result:**  
â†’ Investor receives baseline 12%, despite market signal suggesting 18â€“20% range

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 4: Smart Investor Misses Participation Window

**Investor Strategy:**  
Investor accurately models SPV logic, predicts trigger at Month 13, enters position 2 weeks prior.

**Trigger Outcome:**  
â†’ Trigger correctly occurs  
â†’ Investor classified as late-entry (window started Month 12, required 30-day pre-hold)

**Payout Result:**  
â†’ Investor disqualified from enhancement tier  
â†’ Reverts to 12% interest payment only

---

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario 5: Adversarial Entry â€“ Reversal Trigger

**Investor Strategy:**  
Large institution detects manipulation potential, initiates contrarian volume to suppress trigger

**SPV Behavior:**  
â†’ Flags adversarial flow pattern  
â†’ Switches regime to "reverse convex compression"

**Trigger Outcome:**  
â†’ Skew inversion neutralizes enhancement even as volatility rises  
â†’ Issuer invokes redemption clause

**Payout Result:**  
â†’ Investor receives fixed coupon only, misses upside, experiences spread loss on hedged leg
